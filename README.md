# applet-DisplayOff
Replacement for Screen Off screensaver which disables screen processing when off.  Intended to be used as a when playing or when off screensaver.

This applet is written by Triode and is imported from his old repository on [Google Code](https://code.google.com/archive/p/triodeapplets/). After Google Code shut down its service Triode's plugins and applets got a temporary home on http://triodeplugins.herger.net/ which has now been migrated to LMS-Community.
